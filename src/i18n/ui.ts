      "This office of the Holy Spirit is occupied by the town crier and conductor of the kingdom. The task in this office is to call men and women to repentance through the simple gospel message of the Lord Jesus Christ. An evangelist has an incurable desire to save the lost: 'plundering hell to populate heaven'. They are restless, relentless, and cannot be tied to a denomination or bugged down by herculean administrative tasks. They are God's incendiaries shot into regions of spiritual darkness to enable an engulfing of divine flame of salvation, joy, and peace in the Holy Ghost.",

The pastor provides comfort to the newly born in Christ, changes the spiritual diapers, gives the baby milk, and keeps everyone warm. Jesus pastored the twelve apostles for several years. The office has different names, such as bishop, elder, deacon, overseer, shepherd. This task is well spelled out by apostle Paul and Peter. Pastors may have the weakness of not wanting to give up their spiritual babies who are now maturing in the Lord and seeking to exercise their gift. This could lead to intimidation, manipulation, and domination—in short, witchcraft. A genuine pastor is not afraid to allow the flock to glean from the riches of the Holy Spirit in other verified spiritual offices.",
