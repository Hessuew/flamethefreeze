Sinun elamuksesi tulee levittämään Jeesuksen Kristuksen taivaallista tuoksua, viisautta, läsnäoloa ja olemusta joka puolellesi. Hänen läsnäolonsa tulee olemaan niin suuri sinussa, että kun ihmiset tapaavat sinut, he tulevat kohtaamaan Jeesuksen sinun kauttasi. Hänen elamuksen muuttava voimansa ja rakkautensa kulkee sinun lävitsesi ja ihmiset näkevät Jumalan sinussa.",
