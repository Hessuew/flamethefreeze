The pastor provides comfort to the newly born in Christ, changes the spiritual diapers, gives the baby milk, and keeps everyone warm. Jesus pastored the twelve apostles for several years. The office has different names, such as bishop, elder, deacon, overseer, shepherd. This task is well spelled out by apostle Paul and Peter. Pastors may have the weakness of not wanting to give up their spiritual babies who are now maturing in the Lord and seeking to exercise their gift. This could lead to intimidation, manipulation, and domination—in short, witchcraft.

Other people took care of administrative tasks, and he fed the lambs with the fresh bread of life straight from the oven of heaven, brought from there by the bread shovel of prayer. He spent 2 hours in prayer before speaking in Korea and 3-5 hours before speaking in Europe. Why? It was not the message in itself; the heavens needed to be open for the power of God to change the listeners in that instant. We need to repent and turn back to the power source, which is prayer. Let us revive the prayer life of the church, and we will see the mighty outpouring of the Spirit again. The problem is not more wickedness, more sicknesses and diseases, or more wordliness.

The pastor answered yes. He asked if he had done so. He said no. The young man continued to search in town for anyone who had died so that Jesus could raise them from the dead. After hours, he found a house where a young girl had just died. Praying for the girl, nothing happened. He noticed Jesus drove the parens out, and so did he. Then he prayed, and the dead came back to life. This is the life we should live. A life of divine manifestation of the power of God in our lives!
