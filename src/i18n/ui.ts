      "This office of the Holy Spirit is occupied by the town crier and conductor of the kingdom. The task in this office is to call men and women to repentance through a simple gospel message of the Lord Jesus Christ. An evangelist has an incurable desire to save the lost: 'plundering hell to populate heaven'. They are restless, relentless, and can not be tied to a denomination, or bugged down by herculean administrative tasks. They are God's incendiaries shot into regions of spiritual darkness to enable an engulf of divine flame of salvation, joy and peace in the Holy Ghost.",

The office has different names such as Bishop, Elder, Deacon, Overseer, Shepherd. This task is well spelt out by Apostle Paul and Peter. Pastors may have a weakness of not wanting to give up their spiritual babies who are now maturing in the Lord and seeking to exercise their gift. This could lead to intimidation, manipulation and domination, in short witchcraft.
