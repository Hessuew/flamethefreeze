      "A very important lighthouse in the body of Christ is the prophetic office. It is a full and consistent manifestation of the words of wisdom, knowledge, and discernment of spirit aided by the Holy Spirit to the intent that the Church may be holy, guided, protected, and alert to the wiles of the devils. The prophetic office does not function in the lives of prayerless people and persons who lack adequate knowledge of the scriptures. These are fundamental requirements for the prophetic office. To see or pursue visions without prayer and accurate scriptural interpretation is to repeat the error of Balaam; it would lead to witchcraft, divination, and occultism. Beware of false prophets.",

Pastors may have the weakness of not wanting to give up their spiritual babies who are now maturing in the Lord and seeking to exercise their gift.
